# Gaming Software Engineer in Test (SEIT) Pair Programming Exercise

## Overview

In this exercise you'll be creating a test automation framework for a simple application. It's a pair programming exercise where you'll be in the driving seat and will be accompanied by an engineer.

It's not an exam, so use whatever resources you might normally use to help you solve the problem. Everyone uses Google + Stack Overflow right? And the engineer accompanying you will be there to talk through the problem and help you out if you need.

The exercise is only an hour and there's no right and wrong answer. We're interested in how you approach the problem and to see how you work.

## What you'll be doing

We've created a simple application which allows you to register game results and perform simple aggregations of that data. You'll be responsible for creating a test framework to give us confidence in the application.

https://github.com/jscarfe-sbg/game-result-processor has all the information you'll need, including example requests and responses.

You can use any language / technology you like to write the tests. The app has a HTTP interface so you'll want to use a HTTP client library to interact with it.

## Prerequisites

See https://github.com/jscarfe-sbg/game-result-processor which has details of how to run the application we'll be testing.

Please install ahead of the exercise so we can jump straight in.
